Definition - 
    The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.


A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

A promise is said to be settled if it is either fulfilled or rejected, but not pending.
