Synchronous Programming :-

    1. It will use a single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time.
    2. Sync is blocking -- It will only send the server one request at a time and will wait for that request to be answered by the server.


Asynchronous Programming :-

    1. It is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server at a time.
    2. It increases throughput because multiple operations can run at the same time
