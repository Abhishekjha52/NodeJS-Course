What Is Middleware?
    1. A request handler with access to the application's request-response cycle is known as middleware. 
    2. It's a function that holds the request object, the response object, and the middleware function.
    3. Middleware can also send the response to the server before the request. 
    4. The next middleware function is commonly represented as a variable named next.
    5. Simply middleware is a function that can only be applied using routes. 
    6. We can access and modify request and response data using middleware.


Functions of Middleware
    1. Executes any code 
    2. We can make changes to the request-response objects
    3. Middleware can also End the request-response cycle
    4. Middleware can call the next middleware function in a stack 
    5. We use these functions to modify our middleware to perform many tasks. 
    
    
If we want to block our site for some country or if we're going to check the authentication of a user etc., 
we use middleware for that.

‚≠ê Request-Response Cycle -
    For which it creates a request and response object. 
    The data is then used to generate and send back a meaningful response. 
    Now, to process that data, in Express we use MIDDLEWARES, which can manipulate the request/response object or execute any other code.
